The mitochondrial reference sequence downloaded from 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_012920.1

The first line (">NC_012920.1 .....") had to be altered because
various tools could not cope with a complex description. I have simplified
it to a plain MT.

The file has been renamed to be its CRAM reference MD5 checksum.
(run `md5fa`).

Indexes have been generated for use by `bwa`.
